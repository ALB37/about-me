    <h1> About Seth Donohue </h1>
    <h2> Who is Seth </h2>
      <p> I am a creative hands-on engineer with a big picture approach to life, but a detail oriented approach to life's challenges. I chose to follow the hands-on engineering path with a degree in Plastics Engineering and Vehicle design from Western Washintong University in 2009.</p>
      <p> In 2015 I took a break from the working world to travel the real world while gathering a new focus on what I'd like to spend my life doing. After almost 2 years of exploring different lands and different cultures I returned to Seattle to develop a new lifestyle and to find a career that would eventually match with that lifestyle.</p>
    <h2> What Does Seth Do </h2>
      <p> Seth creates. He creates in code, in metal, in electronics, in art, and in community.</p>
      <p> I recently used my coding skills to program arduino micro controllers for pressure-sensistive lightup shoes, which were part of a night costume for Halloween. I also used electronic assembly skills to wire and solder a power system into a jacket and this jacket then powered lightup wires, LEDs, switches, and connectons to power the shoes and lightups pants.</p>
      <p> With such sweet shoes and a sweet jacket he needed a fun ride, so why not build a unique bicycle? Using his prototyping, welding and fabrications skills he build a 2 seater side-by-side bicycle for him and a buddy to go on adventures.
    <h2> What Makes Seth Go </h2>
      <p> I am driven by big picture challenges that are striving to change the world or just get the creative flow process going. Time doesnt exist when projects are fun!</p>
      <p>The above projects are just recent and quick examples of fun things I can pour my energy into. I have previousl worked in an industry that was developing great ideas, but they were moving in a purely profit direction and rarely concerned about the consequences of our consumer driven soceity.</p>
